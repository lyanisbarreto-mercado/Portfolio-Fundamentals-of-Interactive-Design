            <p>Princess of the forest. She acts rebellious towards her elders, believing that their decisions is only causing more pain. In her teens, she often escaped her duties to hang out with Roci, away from her father Remeriac's watch.</p>

    <p class="chara-des">
Algari lived in a society where it was important to blend in with the forest they live in. But the princess was born a little strangely - her hair, tied to their magic, was of two different shades of green. But still, she could remain in the forest, so other than strange looks, she could not be persecuted. And she would not persecute others, for she cared for the people she is to rule. Especially to make the kingdom safer for her friend Roci to live in.
<br><br>
But the "Cleansing" was right around the corner. And her friend was chosen for these games. She tried to help him, offer ways to escape, but Roci couldn't leave his family behind, and put everyone at risk. So she could only offer advice, for the games that she cannot stop. 
<br><br>
She waited for her friend to return. For weeks. Over a month, and she soon began to break down, thinking her best friend had passed. Just for him to turn up, smiling with his mother beside him. What a relief! But there is something off too. Roci didn't seem to be acting the best. After pressing closer, she realizes that he was almost disconnected from their world, glitches on his body proving how close he was of becoming lost. He had almost gone crazy- he was hearing voices! So she tried to find ways to help her friend, to bring him back to some stability. Then Roci, in a sudden frustration, didn't realize he pulled a ball of light from his head. And this light morphed to become a person.

<br><br>
Algari recognized this person from a previous cleansing. She said they never made it back, but yet here they are- alive. It was then tthat hey realized the nature of Roci's magic, and she is quick to find ways to provide for these survivors. Healing them, caring for them, hiding them from the council and her own father in fear they would be sent out again. All while working to provide justice, without risking her family's life.</p>

            <p>Antcavi Deravau - known by others as Cav - lost her family in the Games when she was ten years old. Having for half of her life she lived in the streets, growing distrustful with the people around her. It wasnâ€™t until she was given a proper chance for a better life that she began to change for the better.</p>

    <p class="chara-des">
Cav lived on a farm with a loving family. Her parents, a brother, and all seemed fine. Even if she was judged for being unable to blend in with the forest, she stuck with her family. All was fine.
<br><br>
But then her brother was called out to participate in the Cleansing. Cav was spared only because she was ten. In a day, her family was gone, and she was moved to an orphanage with nothing but her clothes and a small heirloom. But the orphanage was terrible- they weren't nice like her family. Punishments felt like torture. She was scared all the time. And so a few years in living in that orphanage, she escaped with the things she came with.
<br><br>
And for the most part, that's how she lived. She had one friend, but they were quick to hurt her. She stayed alone, stole food, and became aggressive when the situation arose. It was how she had to live, and she was fine with doing it for as long as it took.
<br><br>
When she became 20, she got arrested. She caused a fight, almost knocking someone unconscious. The guards were quick to recommend the worst punishments. So Cav set off to escape, like she had done before. Just to suddenly bump into a strange creature, a howltar. Who was quick to offer her protection. And for some reason, she followed the howltar back into the place she escaped.
<br><br>
She was given a choice there. The king was hoping to create a program to spare other kanes from the Cleansing. But Cav would have to leave the forest and join the Howltar's kingdom, and learn to live there. And well, the other choice would leave her in prison. So it wasn't much of a choice.
<br><br>
Who knew it would be the greatest change in her life?</p>

            <p>In a yearly event where they and their family are sent out to find their way back, Roci was sent to the "Blank Space". While he managed to escape, he felt like he had gone a little... crazy. But still, he and his family made it back home.
<br><br>
But while struggling to think of ways to fix his mental state, a glowing light emerged from his head and into his hand, and the voices stopped. And in a blink, that light became a sleeping person, one who had suffered a darker fate after going through the same thing as him. </p>

<div id="rociDropdown" class="dropdown-content">
    <p class="chara-des">Roci lived in a society where it was important to blend in with the forest they live in. And so because of his red hair and eyes, he was constantly judged and mistreated. He was an impurity. They wouldn't have been able to put up with the harsh mistreatment and bullying if it wasn't for Algari. Because of their differences (with Algari being a royal, which is another story), they hung out in secret, and practically grew up together. 
<br><br>
They feared their friendship would end when Roci's name was called for the annual "Cleansing". It was dubbed so because everyone believed it was meant to get rid of impurities and their families. It was a death sentence basically. And Algari couldn't do anything. Roci was forced to put on a brave face, for his family, even though it was him who got them into this situation. 
<br><br>
Before they were sent out, a prisoner who returned from this "cleansing" had grabbed Roci as they were being dragged by, warning him of the white space. To find a way out on his own. To use the void as a tool. It made no sense, of course, not until he was actually sent out. He woke up in a blank world, with no sound and no other life. It was horrible. Every hour he spent in that void he got more desperate. He thought he heard voices, and he thought he was saved, but instead they were only the ones in his head.
<br><br>
He doesn't remember how he got out. He just did. And he was thankful too, as he woke up right beside his mother. He was safe at last. But not without some "scars" - his body would occasionally glitch, and the voices never left his head. In fact, they seemed to be.... alive? Voices with a consciousness of their own. They judged him, helped him, warned him. It was strange but... he felt like it wasn't just him going insane.
<br><br>
When they finally made it home, he hid his new quirks to himself. He could get killed if anyone else knew. And thankfully no one else in his family mentioned it either. Roci became the first impurity to survive the cleansing and make it back home alive. 
<br><br>
He couldn't get the voices to leave him alone though. He took solace in Algari, the only other person he trusted, to figure out what was happening. But while he scratched his head and pondered his options, a glowing light emerged from his head and into his hand, and the voices stopped. And in a blink, that light became a sleeping person. Naturally, both he and Algari freaked out. This was an actual random person- that came from his head! The whole thing was weird!
<br><br>
But then Algari said she recognized this person, from a previous cleansing. She said they never made it back, but yet here they are- alive. It wasn't until later that Roci realized that almost all his voices suffered from this fate. They went into the Anti-Void, and they were left for dead. So now he and Algari are working to figure out a way to send these people out and get them a good place to stay for when they eventually awoke- and they always did.
